# Requirements: Mobile Muscle Heatmap Refactor

**Defined:** 2026-01-18
**Core Value:** The body itself must carry the primary signal — users see training distribution at a glance without reading numbers.

## v1 Requirements

### Carousel Navigation

- [x] **NAV-01**: User can swipe horizontally between heatmap and muscle list slides
- [x] **NAV-02**: Slide indicator shows current position (dots or similar)
- [x] **NAV-03**: Default view is heatmap (slide 1)

### Heatmap

- [x] **HEAT-01**: Body fills screen without floating labels
- [x] **HEAT-02**: Each muscle region shows color based on weekly volume
- [x] **HEAT-03**: Color scale uses warm progression (not red as neutral)
- [x] **HEAT-04**: Tapping a muscle opens detail pop-up

### Muscle List

- [x] **LIST-01**: Muscles grouped by region (Shoulders, Chest, Back, Arms, Core, Legs)
- [x] **LIST-02**: Groups are collapsible
- [x] **LIST-03**: Each muscle shows name + progress bar (0-20 sets)
- [x] **LIST-04**: Numeric value shown with secondary emphasis
- [x] **LIST-05**: Tapping a muscle opens detail pop-up

### Detail Pop-up

- [x] **DETAIL-01**: Pop-up shows muscle name, weekly sets, target range
- [x] **DETAIL-02**: Pop-up can be dismissed (tap outside or X)
- [x] **DETAIL-03**: Pop-up highlights corresponding muscle on heatmap

### Visual Language

- [x] **VIS-01**: Red reserved for warnings/exceeding limits only
- [x] **VIS-02**: Consistent accent color across heatmap, progress bars, highlights
- [x] **VIS-03**: Dark neutral background maintained

### Front/Back Toggle

- [x] **TOGGLE-01**: Toggle feels like rotation, not mode switch
- [x] **TOGGLE-02**: Toggle is visually quiet (not emphasized)
- [x] **TOGGLE-03**: State persists across slide navigation

### Component Architecture

- [x] **ARCH-01**: Mobile heatmap component isolated from desktop implementation
- [x] **ARCH-02**: Shared data hooks, separate presentation components

### Custom Grouping

- [x] **GROUP-01**: User can create/edit/delete muscle groups in Settings
- [x] **GROUP-02**: Each muscle belongs to exactly one group
- [x] **GROUP-03**: Default groupings provided as starting point
- [x] **GROUP-04**: Maximum 8 groups allowed
- [x] **GROUP-05**: Custom groupings persist per profile

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Future Enhancements

- **FUTURE-01**: Desktop layout with side-by-side body + panel
- **FUTURE-02**: Week-vs-week comparison view
- **FUTURE-03**: Symmetry warnings (left/right imbalance)
- **FUTURE-04**: Training recommendations based on gaps

## Out of Scope

| Feature                           | Reason                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Desktop layout                    | Separate milestone with different design |
| Analytics/insights on this screen | Belongs in dedicated analytics view      |
| Coaching/recommendation text      | Not this screen's purpose                |
| Data model changes                | Presentation refactor only               |
